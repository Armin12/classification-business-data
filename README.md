# classification-business-data

Here, we have introduced a general framework for getting, cleaning, visualizing, preprocessing, and classification of business data. This framework contains:

- Different strategies to handle missing data depending on the dataset and problem
- Standard procedures for cleaning and preprocessing of data
- Different classifiers for simple and complicated problems (e.g. Random Forest, KNN, Linear/RBF SVM, AdaBoost)
- Different methods for evaluating classification performance
- Different ways to visualize data and showing correlation of features

Functions available in GettingCleaningData.py handle loading, data integration, and data sampling too. 

The data used in the example are extracted from [here](https://opendata.datainfogreffe.fr/explore/?q=Chiffres+Cl%C3%A9s&sort=modified). T and NE are arbitrary columns with numerical values over the last three years.
